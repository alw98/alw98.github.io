I like how much control C++ gives\nthe programmer over inheritance, but sometimes it get's in the way of my preferred way of programming, which is quickly throwing something together."}),ye.push({question:"What's my pick/tip of the week?",response:"Look into prototyping in different languages. Even if a project requires the final product to be in a specific language, like C++, it can be a pain to start in C++.\nSometimes I find it easier to come up with a working, dirty solution in a language like JavaScript. Doing this allows you to quickly try out new ideas, because of how quick and\neasy it is to write JS, and how quickly you can get prototypes up. Doing this allows you to get a nice foundation on the problem, and to optimize out issues for production before they're\neven really a problem. Doing this simple iterative process can greatly increase your productivity on some projects."});var be=function(){return s.a.createElement("div",null,s.a.createElement(te,{qas:ye,title:"CS371p Fall 2019: Week 10"}))},ke=[];ke.push({question:"Abstract",response:"I thought this class was very interesting. I learned a lot of OOP techniques I had never heard of or even considered before,\nand learned a ton about the intricacies of C++. In all honestly, this class is more of a C++ class than anything else."}),ke.push({question:"Curriculum",response:'The class consists of weekly lectures in which students are required to participate, which in my opinion significantly\nincreases the amount of information retained. There are in class HackerRank projects you work on in pairs, which lets you work hands on with the\nconcepts gone over in class, to ensure you have a good grasp on them. The curriculum covers all of the things you need to know to be a good C++ programmer,\nand teaches good programming "etiquette", like the right way to use version control and issue boards, which is very important for programmers in the workforce.'}),ke.push({question:"Assignments",response:"I personally don't think the programming assignments were too hard. I heard some people had quite a bit of trouble with them, but I felt like as long\nas you sat down and came up with a plan before you started programming, and didn't end up programming yourself into a corner, they weren't too bad. The tests, on the other hand,\nI didn't enjoy very much. Having to work with another person during an exam just encourages cheating, and during the midterm that's all that happened everywhere, rampant cheating. Because\nI didn't take part in it(I assumed it wasn't allowed, which the professor said afterwards it was fine to just copy), I ended up taking a hit to my grade. Because we only got half the time to work\non the test by ourselves, it didn't really feel fair."}),ke.push({question:"Conclusion",response:"This was a good class. It covered a lot of useful material, which would be helpful to any computer scientist planning on working in the future. It teaches a lot about the intricacies\nof C++, which sometimes don't have very good analogs in other languages, but are never the less helpful to be knowledgable about. I only wish I would have been able to be more involved in the class,\nbut this semester was pretty rough for me."});var ve=function(){return s.a.createElement(te,{qas:ke,title:"CS371p Fall 2019: Final
