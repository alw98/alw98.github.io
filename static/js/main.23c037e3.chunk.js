Other than that I didn't do much \n          besides play video games and go to classes, since the semester hasn't really picked up yet. \n          I'm sure in the coming weeks I will be a lot busier!"}),j.push({question:"What's in my way?",response:"Right now the only thing in my way is creating all of the acceptance tests for the Collatz project.\n          I believe the spec calls for 200 acceptance tests, which isn't trivial, and I'm not sure how to make them \n          without knowing cycle lengths before hand. It's definitely something I will be thinking about for the next\n          couple of days!"}),j.push({question:"What will I do next week?",response:"Next week I plan to finish Collatz, change this blog to be React with TypeScript, and go win OGT San Antonio \n          for the club I am a part of, TXTS!

I plan to use them more often for sanity\t\n          checking in my own code, the professor gave a really great tip about not using assertions when dealing \n          with user input.

Don't just work off of master, commiting whenever you're done for the day.  \n\t\t  Instead, make use of CI and any time you want to test incremental changes, commit! More important than \n\t\t  commiting often, however, is to commit onto dedicated branches. If you have a new issue you've began work \n\t\t  on, create a new branch for it and keep your work related to that issue solely on that branch, until \n\t\t  you're ready to merge into master!
