Basic github page setup. Will switch to react with typescript eventually^tm
For some reason GitHub doesn't allow user pages to use any branch besides master, so the branch realmaster actually has the source code for this website.
I'm going to figure out a way to automate this deployment because it's annoying to deal with right now.
